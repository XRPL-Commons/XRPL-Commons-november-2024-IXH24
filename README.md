## Tracks

#### Cryptography for blockchain
Projects under this track must demonstrate a clear application of cryptographic techniques to solve the challenge. The challenge can include, but is not limited to, encryption algorithms, zero-knowledge proofs, digital signatures, or other privacy-enhancing technologies.
     
#### XRPL applications
Projects under this track must involve the XRP Ledger in some way, whether through integrations, apps, decentralised finance, or smart contracts. Creativity and innovation in utilising the XRP ledger to solve the challenge are highly encouraged.

-------------
## Rules

- Build on XRP Ledger or on EVM Sidechain
- All projects must have a component on XRPL
-------------
## Judging

4 criteria are equaly weighted
- idea (the originality of the idea)
- implementation (the quality of the code and soundness of the architecture)
- demo (how well you articulate your solution for the user)
- potential (the total value transacted on chain, the business model, and the potential reach)
